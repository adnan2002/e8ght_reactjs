## Recommendation
- Current flow persists the default address only when it’s created and wipes it on logout, so after login there’s nothing to hydrate back (`CreateAddress` writes to `default:address`, `useLogout` removes it).  
```264:276:/home/adnan/Desktop/E8GHT_frontend/vite-project/src/components/CreateAddress.jsx
        if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
          window.localStorage.setItem(STORAGE_KEY, JSON.stringify(addressPayload));
        }
```  
```22:24:/home/adnan/Desktop/E8GHT_frontend/vite-project/src/hooks/useLogout.jsx
      if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
        window.localStorage.removeItem("default:address");
      }
```
- Easiest fix: treat the default address as part of the authenticated user payload. Have the backend return `default_address` (or similar) alongside `/users/me`, and ensure it’s populated during login/bootstrap.
- In `AuthBootstrapper`/`setUser`, when you receive the user object, write `user.default_address` into the same local-storage slot (or into `default:address` keyed by `user.id`). That rehydrates the cache every time the session is restored.
- When the user changes their default address (create/update), update both the backend and the local cache so future logins pick up the new value automatically.
- If you allow multiple users on the same device, store the address under a namespaced key like `default:address:${user.id}` and clear only that key on logout to avoid leaking another user’s data.

Next steps: update the backend response, wire the front-end hydration, and test login → logout → login to confirm the default address repopulates.
