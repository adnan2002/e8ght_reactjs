I have added a cookie to be sent to Callback.jsx


c.SetCookie("default_address", string(defaultAddressJSON), int(s.Config.ACCESS_TOKEN_DURATION.Seconds()), s.Config.COOKIE_PATH, s.cookieDomain(), s.cookieSecure(c), false)


I want you to parse the value of "default_address" cookie.


after that i want you to do the same thing you did in Login.jsx

1- if id is 0 then do not store it in local storage
2- if id is greater than 0, then store it in local storage

name the key: "defualt:address"

I already changed it in Login.jsx so no need to fix it there. that's it
